## Project Specifications

### System description

- Their goals are tracked on Microsoft Excel and the tracking system runs on Microsoft Teams

- Accessing the spreadsheet requires permissions to be given to all parties who need to participate.

- Tracking is done when people are prompted, requiring manual reminders

- The visuals are hard to understand, and cannot be shared to interested parties without a lot of adjustment.

- It’s not clear who works on what, and sometimes opportunities can get replicated on the list.

- Their goals are outlined using the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Timely) criteria.

- The actions are linked to pre-existing work programmes, which ensures that the decarbonisation goals are aligned with current projects.

- The actions are identified as either “Business as usual”(regular operational work) or “Additional”(additional work).

- Each action is described in a clear and specific manner.

- There is a project lead named for each tasks which helps maintain focus on project delivery timelines, and governance bodies are listed, offering structured accountability for meeting the set goals.

- There are metrics and indicators that help to track progress in a quantitative manner.

- There is a column for targets that show benchmarks that have been/could be set for certain tasks.

- There is a column for KPIs, although some of the cells in the column are blank.

- There is a section that identifies whether the actions contribute directly to the Council’s carbon reduction or impacts external entities.

- There are specific timelines for each action which ensures the team stays on track for completion by key deadlines.

- There is a section that details cost and funding, if staff are in a sufficient place to deliver, and potential obstacles and solutions.

### Project Type

i)  Building Decarbonisation 

ii) Renewable Energy

- Their projects are divided into categories as the above
- Could have more categories in the future if new projects are added

### Project Name/Descriptions

- Descriptions about their projects
- Name of projects are quite lengthy- for ease, projects could be given a shorter name and then a proper description for context

### Project Categories

i) Capitalised Maintenance
ii) Leisure Transformation
iii) None

- Related work programmes if any 
- Not all projects are classified

### Determining Action Classification
i) Business as usual
ii) Additional

- Business as usual activity is actions that were undertaken before the Climate Emergency was declared in 2019 (before 2019)
- Additional activity is actions that were implemented in response to the Climate Emergency declaration (after 2019)
- Issue: Some actions that started in years after 2019 are categorised as business as usual when it should be an additional activity (eg. Project 12: Improve understanding of energy management responsibilities with building managers)       

### Project Leader
- Some projects do not have a leader assigned yet
- A few projects have the same leader

### Organisation name where not Durham County Council 
- Currently empty
- Most likely means that all the projects for now are involving Durham County Council (no involvement of other organisations)
- Would there be other organisations involved in the future projects?
