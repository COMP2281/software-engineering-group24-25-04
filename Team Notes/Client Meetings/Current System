Project Specifications

Project Type
i)  Building Decarbonisation 
ii) Renewable Energy
Their projects are divided into categories as the above
Could have more categories in the future if new projects are added

Project Name/Descriptions
Descriptions about their projects
Name of projects are quite lengthy- for ease, projects could be given a shorter name and then a proper description for context

Project Categories
i) Capitalised Maintenance
ii) Leisure Transformation
iii) None
Related work programmes if any 
Not all projects are classified

Determining Action Classification
i) Business as usual
ii) Additional
Business as usual activity is actions that were undertaken before the Climate Emergency was declared in 2019 (before 2019)
Additional activity is actions that were implemented in response to the Climate Emergency declaration (after 2019)
Issue: Some actions that started in years after 2019 are categorised as business as usual when it should be an additional activity (eg. Project 12: Improve understanding of energy management responsibilities with building managers)       

Project Leader
Some projects do not have a leader assigned yet
A few projects have the same leader

Organisation name where not Durham County Council 
Currently empty
Most likely means that all the projects for now are involving Durham County Council (no involvement of other organisations)
Would there be other organisations involved in the future projects?
