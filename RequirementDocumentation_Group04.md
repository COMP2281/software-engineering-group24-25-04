#### User Story(Permission levels (by team/ company))
As a user, I want permission levels on project progress visibility so that my teams can’t view other teams' projects, but managers can grant access if needed.
#### Features
Allows managers to control other staff permissions, ensuring only authorized users can view or edit project progress across teams

#### Scenario
Scenario 1:
team members attempt to view another team’s project progress
Then they are denied access and shown a message that said that they have no permission to view the project

Scenario 2:
When the manager selects a new team member
Then the manager can grant or revoke permission for that user to have access to view or edit the project.
