Meeting to introduce our group to Louise.
Discuss project brief
Ask a few baseline questions to better understand the project and to discuss what direction it needs to go in. 

1. Would you be able to brief us about this project from your point of view and what youâ€™re expecting from us? 
2. Are we able to see the current system? Are we building on this foundation or creating a completely new set-up? (answered in previous question and have been sent the excel doc)
3. Would you like us to build the project locally and present it to you like that  
- Yes
4. Do you have a specific layout in mind? How do you want to present the information?
- Not thought of that at this point in time - (would like visuals for progress (as stated in brief))
5. Could you elaborate on user levels/permissions
- Based on different departments/companies
6. How would you like the monthly reminders to work? Should reminders be sent to individual stakeholders based on their tasks, or would you prefer a centralised reminder to the whole team?
- One general email to everyone, every so often to remind them to update their goals
7. How often would you like to meet with us/have any updates?
- Meet around 1st week of november and establish if we need to meet more often or less often
